# Dedyas's Personal Website and Portfolio

## Welcome\! ðŸ‘‹

Hello and welcome to my personal website and portfolio\! This project serves as a dynamic and interactive showcase of my journey as a **junior front-end developer**. It's built to introduce myself, highlight my skills, and present some of the projects I've been working on. I'm passionate about creating user-friendly and visually appealing web interfaces, and this site is a testament to my dedication and growth in the field.

## Project Overview

This website is more than just a digital resume; itâ€™s a living document of my progress. The goal was to create a clean, responsive, and engaging user experience using foundational front-end technologies. The design philosophy is centered around clarity and ease of navigation, ensuring that visitors can quickly learn about me and explore my work without any hassle. I've integrated subtle animations and a modern layout to make the browsing experience both smooth and enjoyable.

## Technologies Used

This project was built from the ground up using a few core technologies. I focused on solidifying my skills in these areas to build a robust and performant site. The primary technologies include:

  * **HTML5**: For structuring the content and ensuring semantic correctness.
  * **CSS3**: For styling the site, including custom layouts, responsive design, and visual effects. I leveraged **Flexbox** and **Grid** to create a flexible and adaptable layout that looks great on any device.
  * **JavaScript (ES6+)**: To bring the site to life with interactivity and dynamic content. This includes handling events, managing the project carousel, and fetching data to display.
  * **Bootstrap 5**: A popular CSS framework that helped accelerate development by providing a solid foundation of pre-built components and a responsive grid system.
  * **AOS (Animate On Scroll)**: A lightweight library for creating a smooth, professional feel with fade-in animations as users scroll down the page.

## My Journey and Future Goals

As a self-taught developer who started learning in junior high school, my passion for coding has only grown. I've been honing my skills for over two years, using resources like YouTube and AI as my teachers and mentors. While I'm currently focused on front-end development, my ultimate goal is to become a proficient **Android developer** using **React Native**. This website is a stepping stone toward that goal, as it helps me practice core programming concepts and web development principles.

## Tagline: Ingin Menjadi Frontend Handal (namun) Enggan Desain

This tagline, which translates to "Wants to be a reliable Front-End (but) reluctant to design," is a quirky and honest reflection of my journey. It captures my primary focus: building the functionality and logic of a website rather than getting lost in intricate design details. I believe in creating clean, functional, and efficient code, prioritizing a smooth user experience over overly complex visual elements.

## How to Get Started

To explore the code and run this project locally, follow these simple steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. There's no need for a local server, as all the code is client-side.
